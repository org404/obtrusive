vars:
  # List of any args of yours, will be filled during config parsing, one per server.
  my_list:

commands:
  # Basic server setup example. If command is simple we can just pass it as a string.
  - "apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -qq -y"
  # Learning to use formatting.
  - command: 'export COOL_VAR="Hello {name}!"'
    name: "World"  # Script will try to insert any non-keyword vars into 'command'.
  - command: "mkdir -p {dir}"
    dir: "/tmp/filestorage_ajsdnaf"  # Easier to copy this field.
  - command: 'echo $COOL_VAR > {dir}/{it}'
    dir: "/tmp/filestorage_ajsdnaf"  # Easier to copy this field.
    use: "my_list"  # Will put one value from 'my_list' into 'it'.
  # Remember that we are root on the server.
  - command: "cp {dir}/{it} /{it}"
    dir: "/tmp/filestorage_ajsdnaf"  # Easier to copy this field.
    use: "my_list"
    increment: false  # This way we get the same argument, as in command before. Defaults to 'True'.
  - command: "cat /{it}"
    use: "my_list"
    increment: false  # This way we get the same argument, as in command before. Defaults to 'True'.
    show: true  # We want to see output from this command!
  # Last example:
    # Report message. Server "index" is a builtin var that any message has access to.
    # - command: "echo \"[Server #{index}] (ipv4='$(curl -s -4 ifconfig.io)', ipv6='$(curl -s -6 ifconfig.io)') finished deployement.\""
    #   show: True  # Show output, off by default

assertions:
  # Sanity check. Another way to check output, but programatically
  # and you may not be interested in the actual result.
  - command: "cat /{it}"
    use: "my_list"
    increment: false  # This way we get the same argument, as in command before. Defaults to 'True'.
    contains: "Hello "  # This is enough, so being compatible with any changed 'name' is good.
    # We don't really want to see the result here, since we will get report message.
    # show: true
